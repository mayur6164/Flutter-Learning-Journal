# 📱 Basic AppBar Implementation

A clean and standard implementation of the **Material Design AppBar** in Flutter. This project demonstrates the fundamental structure of a top app bar, including navigation controls, titles, and action buttons.

## 🌟 Features
* **Leading Widget:** Custom `IconButton` (Menu) for navigation drawer triggers.
* **Title Alignment:** Centered title for a symmetrical, modern look (`centerTitle: true`).
* **Action Buttons:** Integrated Share and Profile icons in the `actions` array.
* **Styling:** Custom background color (`Colors.blue[400]`) with `elevation: 0` for a flat, clean UI design.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Framework:** Flutter
* **Language:** Dart
* **Widgets Used:** `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, `IconButton`, `Icon`, `Text`.

## 🧠 Logic & Learning
This component explores the `Scaffold` widget's API, specifically how the `appBar` property manages layout constraints automatically (handling status bar height and safe areas).
